In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of a finite Endless Running Game (like Mario Bross).The basic rules for the my_runner are as follows:<br><br>
•the player is a character who runs in a map you took as parameter. <br>
•enemies and obstacles must appear on the opposite side to the player position. <br>
•the player can use the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles and enemies. <br>
•as the player runs, a score, which will be displayed, will increase.<br>
•when the player dies or finishes the map, the score is displayed inside the window<br>

  Lien vers le projet --> [MY_SOKOBAN](./MY_SOKOBAN)

The goal of this project is to develop a copy of the famous sokoban game in terminal mode, using the ncurses library. If all boxes are on storage locations, the player wins and the program must return 0.

>Sokoban (warehouse keeper in Japanese) is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them tostorage locations.

  Lien vers le projet --> [NAVY](./NAVY)

  The goal of this project is to code a terminal version of the very famous "Battleship game". The two players are ONLY allowed to comunicate using thesignals SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2.The map size is 8x8. On each turn, you must display your positions, and then your enemy’s positions. At the end of the game (when all the ships of a player have been hit), you must display whether “I won” (and return 0) or “Enemy won” (and return 1).
