# NAVY

The goal of this project is to develop a copy of the famous sokoban game in terminal mode, using the ncurses library. If all boxes are on storage locations, the player wins and the program must return 0.

>Sokoban (warehouse keeper in Japanese) is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them tostorage locations.
